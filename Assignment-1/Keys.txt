In React.js, keys are used to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in a list. Below given are some steps in which they are used in processing inside the array.

1. Keys are provided to elements inside an array to provide them an identity.
2. Most often, IDs from our data are used as keys for elements in the array.
3. Keys must be unique among themselves but need not be unique globally.
4. Keys should be added to the top-level elements of the list, not child elements.
5. The best practice to use the keys are the unique numbers or strings with unique characters.
